Steven Grossman's home work assignment from the University of Iowa's artificial intelligence class.
My contributions where in analysis.py, qlearningAgents.py, and valueIterationAgents.py. The rest of the code was provided by Bijaya Adhikari from the University of Iowa.

The agents created use Q-Learning with Q-tables to learn which action is best under each state. 
The pacman agent will learn to minimize ghost contact and maximize pellets eaten. You can observe this by running '''python pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -n 10 -l smallGrid -a numTraining=10'''
